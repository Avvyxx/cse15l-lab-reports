# Lab report 5: Putting It All Together

The purpose of this lab report is to design a debugging scenario between a student and a TA to demonstrate our understanding of the process.

## Part 1: Debugging Scenario

Original student post:

## Part 2: Reflection

During the second half of this quarter, we were taught how to create bash scripts and use them to run multiple commands to produce a meaningful output. This was interesting as, throughout the quarter, I wondered how much more use individual commands could have. This as well as using Vim to edit files seem like useful skills to have.
